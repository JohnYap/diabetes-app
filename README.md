**Disclaimer 2: This app is a prototype and was created mainly for educational purposes.  It is a required project at the New York Data Science Academy and was completed in a span of approximately two weeks.  The app's data was a subset of the diabetes studies in https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home and the codes and data calculations have not been rigorously reviewed by an independent professional. Therefore, any inference or conclusions derived from the app's data summaries should be considered exploratory or taken with caution.**
