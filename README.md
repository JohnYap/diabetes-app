Disclaimer 2: This app is a prototype and was created mainly for educational purposes.  It is a required project at the New York Data Science Academy and was completed in a span of approximately two weeks.  The app's data was a subset of the diabetes studies in https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home and the codes and data calculations have not been reviewed by an independent professional. Therefore, any inference or conclusions derived from the app's data summaries should be considered exploratory or taken with caution.

The actual app can be found at:

## Additional Notes:

In the Studies Info feature,

- In Condition Type, the category, Diabetes, includes studies that did not distinguish between the type of diabetes (Type 1 or 2). These may likely be Type 2 diabes because it is the most common type. The Other category includes studies of other less common diabetes types such as gestational diabetes or studies that do not specifically study diabetes but other diseases on diabetes patients.
- In Phase (Clinical Trial), the phase category N/A (or not applicable) represents trials without FDA-defined phases, including trials of devices or behavioral interventions.
